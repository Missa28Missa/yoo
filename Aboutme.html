<div class="mee"><p class="text">Missa if childhood dreams came true.</p><p class="text2">Who am I?</p><p class="text3">Hi! my name is David, I am 16 years old. They call me "Missa" that comes from Misael, my second name. I´m an active student of third year and I´m in a scolarship from "¡Supérate! ADOC" I like pizza, design, and I´m a MTA specialist (Front End). I have two sisters and they are Abigail (10 years old) & Hazel (6 years old), I like to play soccer and swimming.<br>
I´m a young boy, since I was a child I always dreamed about go to the space and explore what´s there. I guess it will be impossible for me, sometimes dreames are just impossible to make them true, but I won't stop me to be a succesfull man in the future. I like many things, I would like to visit the moon one day and put my hand on it and say that my childhood dream came true.

<h1 class="more">Missa, as an artist?</h1>



<div class="abajo">
                  Well, I love art. For me art is life, love and peace. If you ask me if I would like to be an artist in the future, I will answer you "Yes, wh not?". I really like to draw and create new things, for example: I like to draw about how I feel, things I like, I like to produce videos with effects and so many things. I consider myself s an artist & I know that inside me is someone that hasn´t showed to the world his art.

</div>
<div class="abajoo">
                  Imagine, I grew dreaming to be an astronaut. Then I started to study and I learned a lot of things while I was growing, now I see that if I want to be an astronaut I have to study a carreer and that is not free, I have to pay a big amount of money for it. I cannot pay that money, so I have to decide what to do. If I love art, and I´m good on it.. Why not?
</div>
<div class="abajooo">
                  I´m still growing and I don´t know what will happen in the next five, seven, ten years. I´ll try to make my dreams come true, it will be difficult, but not impossible. I also want to be a famous guy on internet, I see myself making streams of me doing whatever I want. That´s my biggest dream (in terms of earning money doing what I love the most). So, I´m still thinking about what to do in this time.
